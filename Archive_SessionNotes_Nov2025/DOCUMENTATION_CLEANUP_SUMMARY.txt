==============================================

GOAL: Create one master roadmap with big picture vision, archive implementation clutter

ACTIONS TAKEN:
--------------

1. CREATED: 2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md (9.8K)
   - Big picture: Mini Bonsai Tree GUI vision
   - Current stage: Baseline implementation
   - Key principle: Clash-free by DESIGN (programmatic generation prevents clashes)
   - No implementation details (those live in prompt.txt and code)
   
2. UPDATED: docs/README.md
   - Now points to 2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md as primary reference
   - Simplified to quick start guide
   - Removed outdated template-driven confusion
   
3. UPDATED: prompt.txt
   - Added big picture reference at top
   - Links to 2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md for strategic context
   
4. ARCHIVED: 20 session-specific documents → Archive_SessionNotes_Nov2025/
   - URGENT_READ_FIRST.txt (outdated validation issues)
   - FUTURE_ROADMAP.md (MEP placement componentization - too narrow)
   - GLOBAL_OFFSET_PATTERN_REFERENCE.md (solved issue)
   - 17 session notes (POC testing, workflow evolution, fixes applied, etc.)
   - Created Archive README explaining why archived

REMAINING ACTIVE DOCS:
---------------------

Root level:
- 2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md ← PRIMARY REFERENCE (big picture)

Subdirectories:
- docs/README.md ← Quick start guide
- Archive_SessionNotes_Nov2025/ ← Historical reference (20 files)

External references:
- ~/Documents/bonsai/prompt.txt ← Current tactical status (updated every session)
- ~/Documents/bonsai/StandingInstructions.txt ← Development protocols

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
-----------------

✅ One source of truth for big picture (2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md)
✅ Clear separation: Strategic (roadmap) vs Tactical (prompt.txt) vs Historical (archive)
✅ Removed implementation clutter (concrete solutions change, vision doesn't)
✅ Emphasized: Clash-free by DESIGN not by fixing (programmatic generation)
✅ Clear GUI vision: Automate grunt work, save 90% cost/time
✅ Clear current stage: Building baseline to prove DXF → 3D database works

ONBOARDING PATH:
----------------

New session:
1. Read StandingInstructions.txt (protocols)
2. Read prompt.txt (current status)
3. (Optional) Read 2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md if need big picture context

New developer:
1. Read 2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md (big picture first!)
2. Read prompt.txt (current status)
3. Read StandingInstructions.txt (protocols)

PHILOSOPHY:
-----------

- Vision documents (roadmap) = STABLE, big picture, timeless
- Status documents (prompt.txt) = DYNAMIC, tactical, current session
- Implementation details = IN THE CODE, not documentation

This keeps docs lean, focused, and maintainable.
