# Archive: Session Notes (November 2025)

**Archived:** 2025-11-18
**Reason:** Historical session notes moved to avoid clutter in main project folder

---

## What's Here

This folder contains **session-specific documentation** from November 2025 development work:

- Session handoff notes
- POC testing summaries
- Implementation-specific fixes
- Workflow evolution notes
- Lessons learned documents

---

## Why Archived

These documents captured **tactical decisions and implementation details** during active development.

**They've been superseded by:**
- `2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md` - Strategic vision and big picture
- `prompt.txt` - Current tactical status (updated each session)
- Code implementation itself (the source of truth)

---

## If You Need Historical Context

These files remain useful for:
- Understanding decision rationale during Nov 2025
- Debugging issues related to specific sessions
- Learning about workflow evolution
- Reference for similar problems

**But for current work, start with:**
1. `2Dto3D_ROADMAP.md` (big picture)
2. `prompt.txt` (current status)
